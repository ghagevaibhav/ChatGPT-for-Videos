"In this video we'll be looking for edge lookup. Now, if you see on the screen, I have a table. Now if you see in the previous one, vertical table. Now this is a horizontal table. How do you understand a horizontal table? If you see, I have the row headings. Earlier I had something column headings. If I apply a function on this, it becomes a hlookup. What exactly is hlookup for? If you see, I have written here top products like say mobile phone, camera and all. And the product code, quantity and price. With respect to the product, I want to find out the price. I have written here top product as mobile phone. And if I want to find out a price, let's say mobile has a price of 26.95. So how I can type a formula for Hlookup is the same way equal to hlookup. Now the very first thing it says as lookup value comma, second thing it says as your table array. Now that's my table array. So I'll select here till I get the entire table and I'll put a comma. Next is the row index number. In Vlookup it was as column index number, but in hlookup it is row index number. With respect to table, which is the row I want. I want the fourth row. That is the price. So I'll type here, comma, four, four, comma, zero. That's it. So now I'm expecting the mobile that the answer is 26.95. Once I press so I've got the right answer. Let's try one more. If I want the answer for the cosmetics. So I'll just type here cosmetics, I'll copy paste control c. Control v. So right. So I've got the answer for cosmetics. That is 35.95. So same way like vertical lookup. That is Vlookup. We have something here, Hlookup. And the only difference is instead of column index number, we have to put as row index number. And instead of Vlookup, I have proposed the answer as hlookup. So that's all for this video."
